# DyeJS
DyeJS (Terminal Dye) is a lightweight and performant terminal coloring/dye library that is super easy to use and maintain.

To use DyeJS, simply download dye.js and place it is your working node.js directory. 
The following is an example of painting a string blue:
```javascript
const dye = require('./dye.js');

const str = dye.blue('Hello, World!');

console.log(str);
process.stdout.write(str);
```
